# FyreBot
### Creating a translation:
1. Go to https://github.com/FyreHost/FyreBot/blob/main/translations/en-US.yml and copy the contents into a new file.
2. Name the file with the language code your wish to translate to. Codes at https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales
3. Once you edit the contents put it into the translations folder and restart the bot.
4. All translations are automatically made at runtime using the command runners language settings in Discord.
